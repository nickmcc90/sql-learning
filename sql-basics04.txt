SQL is used in RDBMS

//timestamp: 2:56

In a relational database, data is stored in
multiple tables. Different tables are related to
certain columns of other tables, forming a relation.

There are five types of SQL commands.
DDL - Data definition langauge
(Create, drop, alter, truncate)

DML - Data manipulation langauge
(Insert, update, delete, merge)

DCL - Data control langauge
(grant, revoke)

TCL - Transaction control langauge
(commit, rollback, savepoint)

DQL - Data query langauge
(select)

Let's look at each of them in detail.




1. DDL
The syntax to CREATE a table can be like this:

CREATE TABLE table_name
(
  column1   DATA_TYPE
  column2   DATA_TYPE CONSTRAINT
  CONSTRAINT  constraint_name...
)

# each column is associated to a data type and optionally a constraint.

Here is an actual example of a table being created:

CREATE TABLE STUDENTS
(
  ID   VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY
 ,FIRST_NAME VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
 ,LAST_NAME VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
 ,GENDER VARCHAR(10) CHECK (GENDER IN ('M', 'F', 'Male', 'Female'))
 ,AGE INT
 ,DOB DATE
 ,GRADE FLOAT
 ,IS_ACTIVE BOOLEAN
 ,CONSTRAINT CH_STUDENTS_AGE CHECK (AGE > 0)
)

//timestamp: 4:42

VARCHAR can store numbers, special characters, and letters.
The rest are self explanatory.

1b. Types of CONSTRAINTS

CHECK - Helps control the values being inserted
NOT NULL - Helps ensure the column values are never NULL
UNIQUE - helps ensure the column values are always unique. Multiple
nulls in these columns are allowed. Two nulls are not the same.

//timestamp: 7:20

PRIMARY KEY - ensures all values in column are unique with no NULL values.
FOREIGN KEY - parent/child relationship between tables. Child table references
values from parent table.
DROP - deletes stuff
ALTER - alters stuff. Examples:
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME TO New_table_name
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN column_name TO New_column_name



2. DML
//timestamp: 9:03
INSERT Examples:
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, col2, col3)
VALUES ('val1', 'val2', 'val3')

Listing the column names aren't mandatory, I think inserting values
starts from the leftmost column and goes to the right.

INSERT INTO table_name VALUES
('row1-value1', 'row1-value2'), ('row2-value1', 'row2-value2')
//timestamp 9:17
