These notes will be from a course on youtube, because I don't want to
pay for the pluralsight sub.

Video 1: Roadmap to learning SQL
The SQL language you learn does not matter starting out.
Make sure to have a database and an IDE downloaded.

CHECK OUT SPRINGBOARD FOR A BOOTCAMP COURSE TO LEARN!!!

---HOW TO LEARN BASIC SQL W CONCEPTS
1. Relational database system (RDBMS)
1a. How data is stored in a relational database?
1b. What is a schema wrt a relational database?

2. SQL commands
2a. DDL, DML, DCL, TCL, DQL
2b. What are commands under each of these categories and
what do these commands actually do?

3. Data types
3a. String types like VARCHAR or TEXT
3b. Integer type like INT, NUMBER
3c. DATE
3d. FLOAT / DECIMAL
3e. BOOLEAN
3f. Identity column (auto increment column)

4. Constraints
4a. Primary key
4b. Foriegn key
4c. Check constraint, not null constraint, unique constraint, default.

5. Normalization in SQL
5a. Normal forms like 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF
5b. Why do DBs need to be normalized?


timestamp: 11:37

6. Operators
6a. Arithmetic Operators
6b. Logical operator
6c. Comparison operator
6d. UNION, UNION ALL operator

7. CASE statement
7a. simple case statement vs nested cases

8. Important SQL clauses
8a. DISTINCT
8b. Order by
8c. Limit / top clause

9. INNER JOIN
9a. Fetching data from multiple tables.

Leetcode has good SQL problems

To be a DATA ANALYST OR DATA SCIENTIST, you need Intermediate level SQL skills...


--INTERMEDIATE SQL

1. Group By and Having clause

//timestamp: 16:12

2. Aggregate functions
2a. min, max, avg, sum, count

3. Order of execution
3a. Helps you get unstuck in debugging

4. Sub-queries

5. CTE table / WITH clause

6. All type of Joins
6a. LEFT join, RIGHT join, FULL OUTER join
6b. CROSS join, SELF join

7. In-built functions
7a. String functions like substring, position, coalesce etc.
7b. Date functions like Extract, To_Date etc.

8. Window functions
//timestamp: 17:53
8a. RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER, LEAD, LAG
8b. FIRST_VALUE, LAST_VALUE, NTH_VALUE

9. Views

Leetcode has good problems again for this.


SQL CASE STUDY FROM DATA WITH DANNY



--ADVANCED SQL
1. Recursive SQL queries
2. PIVOT table / CROSSTAB function
3. Materialized views
4. Stored procedure
5. User defined functions



--SQL FOR DB / SQL DEVELOPERS
1. Indexes
2. Triggers
3. Temporary tables
4. Dynamic execution of SQL statments
5. PL/SQL concepts
5a. 

6. Performance tuning
//timestamp: 25:01. Done with video after writing down the 5abcd stuff
